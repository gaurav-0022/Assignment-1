## Question 1

Simulate 30 rolls with =RANDBETWEEN(1,6). What is the probability of rolling a 3 exactly 5 times? (Hint: Use BINOM.DIST)

**Answer:**

We model this using Binomial distribution:

n = 30 trials
p = 1/6 (probability of getting 3)
x = 5 successes

Excel formula:

=BINOM.DIST(5,30,1/6,FALSE)

**Probability ≈ 0.135** (approx)

## Question 2

Generate 100 values in Excel using the continuous uniform distribution RAND() and plot a histogram. Describe the shape of the distribution.

**Answer:**

Steps:

1. In Excel, type =RAND() in 100 cells
2. Insert → Histogram

**Shape of distribution:**

The histogram will be approximately **flat (rectangular)**, meaning all values between 0 and 1 occur with almost equal frequency.

This shows a **uniform distribution**.

## Question 3

A dataset has a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 5. What percentage of values lie between 45 and 55 if the data follows a normal distribution?

**Answer:**

45 to 55 = Mean ± 1σ

According to Empirical Rule:

**About 68%** of values lie within 1 standard deviation.

## Question 4

What is the concept of standardization (z-score) and why is it important in data analysis? Explain the formula and transformation.

**Answer:**

Standardization converts data into a common scale.

**Formula:**

z = (x − μ) / σ

Where:
x = data value
μ = mean
σ = standard deviation

**Importance:**

* Allows comparison between datasets
* Removes unit dependency
* Helps detect outliers
* Required for ML algorithms

After transformation:
Mean becomes 0
Standard deviation becomes 1

## Question 5

What is Kurtosis and its types?

**Answer:**

Kurtosis measures the **peakedness** of a distribution.

### Types:

1. **Leptokurtic** – Sharp peak, heavy tails
2. **Mesokurtic** – Normal distribution
3. **Platykurtic** – Flat peak, light tails

## Question 6

Explain why uniform distribution is a good model for rolling a fair die.

**Answer:**

Each number (1–6) has equal chance (1/6).

No outcome is favored.

Hence, probabilities are equal → Uniform distribution.

## Question 7

Use Excel to compute probability of getting at least 8 successes in 15 trials with p = 0.5

**Answer:**

We calculate:

P(X ≥ 8) = 1 − P(X ≤ 7)

Excel formula:

=1-BINOM.DIST(7,15,0.5,TRUE)

**Probability ≈ 0.500**

## Question 8

How does log transformation help in stabilizing variance and making data more normally distributed?

**Answer:**

Log transformation:

* Reduces skewness
* Compresses large values
* Stabilizes variance

**Benefits:**

* Makes data closer to normal
* Improves model performance
* Handles exponential growth

Common formula:

log(x)

Used in finance, ML, economics
