# Power BI – Data Preparation & Modeling Assignment

---

## Question 1: What is Data Loading in Power BI and why is it considered the first step of analysis?

**Answer:**  
Data Loading in Power BI is the process of importing data from different sources such as Excel, CSV, databases, or web sources into Power BI.

It is considered the first step of analysis because:
- Analysis cannot be performed without data
- It helps verify data structure and quality
- It prepares data for cleaning, modeling, and visualization
- All further steps depend on successfully loaded data

## Question 2: Explain the difference between “Load” and “Transform Data” in Power BI.

**Answer:**

| Load | Transform Data |
|----|----|
| Directly loads data into Power BI | Opens Power Query Editor |
| No changes applied to data | Data can be cleaned and shaped |
| Faster process | Used for data preparation |
| Used when data is clean | Used when data has errors or nulls |

## Question 7: Create a new column to calculate Recovery Rate.

**Answer (DAX):**

```DAX
Recovery Rate = 
DIVIDE([Recovered_Cases], [Confirmed_Cases], 0)

---

## Question 8: Create a summarized table showing total confirmed cases by Country.
**answer 

Confirmed Cases by Country =
SUMMARIZE(
    Data,
    Data[Country],
    "Total Confirmed Cases", SUM(Data[Confirmed_Cases])
)
