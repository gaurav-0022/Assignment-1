# Probability Basics assignment – Questions & Answers

## Question 1

A die is rolled. What is the probability of getting:

### (a) An even number

**Answer:**
Sample space = {1,2,3,4,5,6}

Even numbers = {2,4,6}

Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total outcomes

= 3/6 = **1/2**

### (b) A number greater than 4

**Answer:**
Numbers greater than 4 = {5,6}

Probability = 2/6 = **1/3**

## Question 2

In a class of 50 students:

* 20 like Mathematics (M)
* 15 like Science (S)
* 5 like both subjects

Find the probability that a student chosen at random likes Mathematics or Science.

**Answer:**

P(M ∪ S) = [n(M) + n(S) − n(M ∩ S)] / Total

= (20 + 15 − 5) / 50
= 30 / 50

**Probability = 3/5**

## Question 3

A bag has 3 red and 2 blue balls. If one ball is drawn randomly and is red, what is the probability that the next ball is also red (without replacement)?

**Answer:**
Remaining balls = 2 red, 2 blue

Total remaining balls = 4

Probability = 2/4 = **1/2**

## Question 4

The population of a school is divided into 60% boys and 40% girls. If you want equal representation of both genders in the sample, which method should you use and why?

**Answer:**

**Stratified Sampling**

**Reason:**
The population is divided into strata (boys and girls) and equal samples are taken from each group to ensure fair representation.

## Question 5

The average height of 1000 students = 160 cm. A sample of 100 students shows an average height = 158 cm. Find the sampling error.

**Answer:**

Sampling Error = Population Mean − Sample Mean

= 160 − 158

**Sampling Error = 2 cm**

---

## Question 6

The population mean salary is ₹50,000 with σ = ₹5,000. If we take a sample of 100 employees, what is the standard error of the mean (SEM)?

**Answer:**

SEM = σ / √n

= 5000 / √100
= 5000 / 10

**SEM = ₹500**

---

## Question 7

In a group of 100 students:

* 40 like Cricket (C)
* 30 like Football (F)
* 10 like both Cricket and Football

Find the probability that a student likes at least one sport.

**Answer:**

P(C ∪ F) = (40 + 30 − 10) / 100

= 60 / 100

**Probability = 3/5**

---

## Question 8

From a deck of 52 cards, two cards are drawn without replacement. What is the probability that both are Aces?

**Answer:**

P = (4/52) × (3/51)

= 12 / 2652

**Probability = 1/221**

---

## Question 9

A factory produces bulbs with 2% defective rate. If 5 bulbs are chosen at random, what is the probability that all are non-defective?

**Answer:**

Non-defective rate = 98% = 0.98

Probability = (0.98)^5

**Probability ≈ 0.9039**

---

## Question 10

Differentiate between discrete and continuous random variables with examples.

**Answer:**

| Discrete Random Variable    | Continuous Random Variable |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Takes countable values      | Takes infinite values      |
| Has gaps between values     | No gaps between values     |
| Example: Number of students | Example: Height, weight    |
| Example: Dice outcome       | Example: Time taken        |
